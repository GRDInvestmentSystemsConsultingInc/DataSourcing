Unpublished data.\n\n\"How-to-use\" the Australian data, from the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nThe two series are:\n(1) The RBA's spot and forward transactions with dealers in the foreign\nexchange market.\n(2) The RBA's spot and forward transactions with the Australian Government\nand with 'other' counterparties.\nSome researchers have been using the first series as a proxy for foreign exchange market intervention, but this is not appropriate.\n\nThe RBA engages in spot or forward transactions with dealers in the market virtually every day. Most of these transactions are never intended to influence the exchange rate. Rather, they are intended to cover orders for foreign exchange from clients such as the Australian Government. When the RBA sells foreign exchange to a client, it has the choice of meeting this out of its holdings of foreign exchange (official reserves) or buying the equivalent amount of foreign exchange in the market. Most of the time it does the latter, though even then the timing of the sale and purchase may not coincide precisely as the RBA seeks to time its transactions in the market to achieve the most favourable exchange rate possible. The RBA can also engage in foreign exchange transactions with counterparties other than dealers as a means of covering client orders.\n\nIn isolation, therefore, RBA transactions with dealers should not be interpreted as a time series on intervention. A closer approximation of an \"intervention\" series would be provided by the net of the two series - i.e. the net of transactions with dealers and transactions with the Australian Government and other counterparties. But even this has shortcomings because, as noted above, the RBA does not always match market purchases against sales originating from client transactions on a daily basis. The net series, therefore, should be filtered to exclude small transactions to provide an indication of intervention.\"\n\nFurther information on these series are available from the following sites:\n\nhttp://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2004/2004-06.html\nhttp://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/rba/2006/html/oper-fin-mkts.html\n\nThese series are made available only for research purposes.\n\nTable A4 of the Reserve Bank Bulletin also details transactions with the market, as well as transactions with the Government and 'other' parties, on a monthly basis. These data are available electronically from the RBA website. Note that the data published in the Bulletin are on a settlement (value date) basis. The series of transactions with 'other' counterparties also includes additional items not in the above daily series, notably interest earnings on reserves.\n\nhttp://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/tables/index.html#rba",

A closer approximation of an \"intervention\" series would be provided by the net of the two series - i.e. the net of transactions with dealers and transactions with the Australian Government and other counterparties. But even this has shortcomings because, as noted above, the RBA does not always match market purchases against sales originating from client transactions on a daily basis. The net series, therefore, should be filtered to exclude small transactions to provide an indication of intervention.\"\n\nFurther information on these series are available from the following sites:\n\nhttp://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2004/2004-06.html\nhttp://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/rba/2006/html/oper-fin-mkts.html\n\nThese series are made available only for research purposes.\n\nTable A4 of the Reserve Bank Bulletin also details transactions with the market, as well as transactions with the Government and 'other' parties, on a monthly basis. These data are available electronically from the RBA website. Note that the data published in the Bulletin are on a settlement (value date) basis. The series of transactions with 'other' counterparties also includes additional items not in the above daily series, notably interest earnings on reserves.\n\nhttp://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/tables/index.html#rba",

Banco de Mexico provides background information on its \"Contingent dollar sales mechanism,\" which constitutes sterilized\r\ninterventions (14 total) from February 1997-June 2001:\r\n\r\n\"In February 1997, the Foreign Exchange Commission, composed of officials from the Ministry of Finance and Banco de M\u00e9xico (and responsible for Mexico's foreign exchange policy) announced the establishment of an auction mechanism to sell US dollars. This mechanism was implemented in order to ease the volatility in the foreign exchange market without violating the principles inherent in the prevailing floating exchange rate regime (see the Exchange Commission Statement and Banco de M\u00e9xico's Circular 10/97). Implementation of the mechanism was possible due to a significant accumulation of reserves, mainly achieved through the auction of foreign exchange options.\r\n\r\nUnder this mechanism, Banco de M\u00e9xico undertook daily sales of up to USD200 million, with a minimum price for the dollar set at 1.02 times the Mexican peso, as determined by the FIX on the preceding day. If any bids were allocated during the auction, the minimum price for the dollar on the following day was set at 1.02 times the weighted average peso exchange rate determined in the auction. The Contingent Dollar Sales Mechanism was effective until June 2001. It was triggered and implemented only fourteen days during the entire period, for a total amount of USD 1.950 billion sold. Furthermore, almost 60% of total dollar sales took place between August 1998 and January 1999, a period that was characterized by very high volatility in international financial markets.\"\r\n\r\n(http://www.banxico.org.mx/sistema-financiero/estadisticas/mercado-cambiario/operaciones-vigentes-del-banco-de-mexico-en-el-mer/mecanismos/february-1997---june-2001--co.html)\r\n\r\n2. Banco de Mexico has two added notes about the history of the Contingent dollar sales mechanism:\r\n\r\n\"1. Daily auction of dollars conducted as stipulated by the Foreign Exchange Commission in the press bulletin of February 19,1997 and circular 10/97 of Banco de M\u00e9xico. 2. On September 10,1998 there was also a discretionary intervention for 278 million dollars.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Banco de Mexico has added additional intervention data.
